# CONTRIBUTING

----

Thanks for your interest in contributing to this package! We're hoping it can be made even better through community contributions.

## Requests and feedback

For any bugs, issues or feature requests please open an [issue](https://github.com/lvgig/test-aide/issues) on the project.

## Requirements for contributions

### Code formatting

Contributions should be formatted with `black` and naming should follow [pep8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). The project uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to manage pre-commit hooks. After setting up your development environment simple run `pre-commit install` to initalise pre-commit for the repository. Black is included in the pre-commit hook configuration.

### Tests

All existing tests must pass and new functionality added must be tested. Tests must be written with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/). We aim for 100% coverage of new functionality.

### Docstrings

Docstrings need to be updated or added for new functionality.
